# TASK 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
In this task, the concepts that we used included -
1.data pro-processing since the dataset contains null values, 
2. Exploratory data analysis to visualize the data
3. Machine Learning Algorithm to train the model
# Insight : 
Titanic Survival Prediction helped me better understand the concepts of data analysis, revealing patterns and correlations. This project enhanced my skills in predictive modeling, feature selection for training model, providing valuable experience in the world of data science.

# TASK 2: Iris Flower Classification
In this task, the concepts that were used included -
1. Advanced Data Visualizations
2. Machine Learning algorithms to train the model
# Insight : 
In Iris Flower Classification, I gained insights into pattern recognition and model evaluation. This project helped me imporove my skills in classification techniques, feature importance, and patern evaluation, contributing to my data science skillset.

# TASK 3: Sales Prediction using Python 
In this task, the concepts that were used included -
1. Advanced Data Visualization
2. Machine Learning algorithms
